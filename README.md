# Java Noise

A project where I will produce a grid of squares and add noise etc. to them. 

This project has been built from the ground up in Java using `Swing` and `AWT`. 

Initially this project was planned to be a random noise generator. Instead, I will attempt to re-create **Conway's Game of Life**. I decided on keeping the name "Java Noise", as it seemed fitting. At a first glance The Game of Life seems to be nothing more than a random mess of pixels on the screen. Hopefully this project can show that it's much more than that.
